2. Create a new application
3. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback` to your Redirect URIs
4. Note your Client ID and Client Secret

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_strava_client_id
REACT_APP_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_strava_client_secret
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
